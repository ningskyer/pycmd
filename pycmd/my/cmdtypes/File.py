class File(BaseParamType):
    """Declares a parameter to be a file for reading or writing.  The file
    is automatically closed once the context tears down (after the command
    finished working).

    Files can be opened for reading or writing.  The special value ``-``
    indicates stdin or stdout depending on the mode.

    By default, the file is opened for reading text data, but it can also be
    opened in binary mode or for writing.  The encoding parameter can be used
    to force a specific encoding.

    The `lazy` flag controls if the file should be opened immediately or
    upon first IO.  The default is to be non lazy for standard input and
    output streams as well as files opened for reading, lazy otherwise.

    Starting with Click 2.0, files can also be opened atomically in which
    case all writes go into a separate file in the same folder and upon
    completion the file will be moved over to the original location.  This
    is useful if a file regularly read by other users is modified.

    See :ref:`file-args` for more information.
